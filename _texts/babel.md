{:.indent-3}HAT IS PRESENTED to us here is a most intriguing case of<br>
{:.indent-3}sympathies and differences. This is by no means the ﬁrst in-<br>
{:.indent-3}stance of imaging Borges’s total library. Earlier attempts were<br>
rather literal graphic representations of Borges’s verbal account of the<br>
universe he chooses to call “The Library of Babel.” Desmazie(')res’s etch-<br>
ings are no mere illustrations of the writer’s words; they are the prod-<br>
uct of a parallel imagmination, inspired to create in visual images his own, <br>
equivalent, universe. Or is it, rather, a Piranesian nightmare?<br>

{:.indent-1}The plates collected here represent the second and ﬁnal state of those <br>
initially created to accompany the text in a special edition of Les Amis<br>
du Livre Contemporain. Like the famous _Carceri d’invenzione_... by that<br>
masterful Italian etcher, Giambattista Piranesi, Desmazie(')res calls the<br>
second state, which he issued as a portfolio, _Onze Estampes Inspirées de<br>
la Nouvelle... inventées et gravées par Erik Desmazie(')res_. And not unlike the<br>
_Carceri_, these plates are denser, more tortuous, oppressive, and ominous<br>
than those of the ﬁrst state.<br>

{:.indent-1}Borges’s universe is described from the inside; it has no entrance and<br>
no exit. The writer chooses to call it “The Library of Babel,” and it is this<br>
title that inspires Desmazie(')res to use an image of that tower as the entry<br> 
to his own imaginary universe, or alternatively, his own imaginary<br>
library. The iconographic model is that of the spiral ziggurat that ﬁrst<br>
appears in two paintings by Pieter Brueghel, who led the way in por-<br>
traying the tower by itself, excised from the illustrated Biblical narrative<br>
of which it is a part. Desmazie(')res’s tower, more like Brueghel’s smaller<br>
panel now in Rotterdam, practically ﬁlls out the place, and completely<br>
overshadows the puny human creatures teeming at its doors. Yet in _Gene-<br>
sis_, the Tower of Babel stands for man’s arrogant attempt to reach heaven <br>
with one of his constructions. God’s punishment for this audacity is the<br>
destruction of the tower, along with the proliferation of languages that<br></p>
