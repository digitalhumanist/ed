{:.indent-3}HAT IS PRESENTED to us here is a most intriguing case of
{:.indent-3}sympathies and differences. This is by no means the ﬁrst in-
{:.indent-3}stance of imaging Borges’s total library. Earlier attempts were
rather literal graphic representations of Borges’s verbal account of the
universe he chooses to call “The Library of Babel.” Desmazie(')res’s etch-
ings are no mere illustrations of the writer’s words; they are the prod-
uct of a parallel imagmination, inspired to create in visual images his own, 
equivalent, universe. Or is it, rather, a Piranesian nightmare?

{:.indent-1}The plates collected here represent the second and ﬁnal state of those 
initially created to accompany the text in a special edition of Les Amis 
du Livre Contemporain. Like the famous _Carceri d’invenzione_... by that
masterful Italian etcher, Giambattista Piranesi, Desmazie(')res calls the 
second state, which he issued as a portfolio, _Onze Estampes Inspirées de 
la Nouvelle... inventées et gravées par Erik Desmazie(')res_. And not unlike the 
_Carceri_, these plates are denser, more tortuous, oppressive, and ominous than those of the ﬁrst state.

{:.indent-1}Borges’s universe is described from the inside; it has no entrance and 
no exit. The writer chooses to call it “The Library of Babel,” and it is this 
title that inspires Desmazie(')res to use an image of that tower as the entry 
to his own imaginary universe, or alternatively, his own imaginary 
library. The iconographic model is that of the spiral ziggurat that ﬁrst appears in two paintings by Pieter Brueghel, who led the way in por- 
traying the tower by itself, excised from the illustrated Biblical narrative 
of which it is a part. Desmazie(')res’s tower, more like Brueghel’s smaller 
panel now in Rotterdam, practically ﬁlls out the place, and completely 
overshadows the puny human creatures teeming at its doors. Yet in _Gene- 
sis_, the Tower of Babel stands for man’s arrogant attempt to reach heaven 
with one of his constructions. God’s punishment for this audacity is the 
destruction of the tower, along with the proliferation of languages that</p>
