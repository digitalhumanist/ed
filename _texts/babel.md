{:.indent-3}HAT IS PRESENTED to us here is a most intriguing case of
sympathies and differences. This is by no means the ﬁrst in-
stance of imaging Borges’s total library. Earlier attempts were
rather literal graphic representations of Borges’s verbal account of the
universe he chooses to call “The Library of Babel.” Desmazieres’s etch-
ings are no mere illustrations of the writer’s words; they are the prod-

uct of a parallel nn'agm'ation, inspired to create m' visual images his own, equivalent, universe. Or is it, rather, a Piranesian nightmare?

The plates collected here represent the second and ﬁnal state of those initially created to accompany the text in a special edition of Les Amis du Livre Contemporain. Like the famous Carceri d’invenzione. .. by that masterful Italian etcher, Giambattista Piranesi, Desmazie‘res calls the second state, which he issued as a portfolio, Onze Estampes Inspirées de la Nouvelle . . . inventées et gravées par Erik Desmazier‘es. And not unlike the Carcm', these plates are denser, more tortuous, oppressive, and ominous than those of the ﬁrst state.
